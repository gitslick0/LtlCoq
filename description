Description: This contribution contains a shallow embedding of Linear
Temporal Logic (LTL) based on a co-inductive representation of program
executions.  Temporal operators are implemented as inductive
(respectively co-inductive) types when they are least (respectively
greatest) fixpoints. Several general lemmas,
that correspond to LTL rules, are proved.
Keywords: temporal logic, infinite transition systems, co-induction
